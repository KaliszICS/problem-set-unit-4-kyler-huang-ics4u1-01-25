Card should allow values of any number (or at least any positive number).  Games may require more diverse values than 1-13
Methods that do not do anything when given invalid values should throw exceptions (add for instance).  Constructors should also filter through provided data for the user (remove the null values).
DiscardPile toString only ever shows 1 card.
No space after age in Player toString method.
Don't use break in a method when there is no code left.  Just return.
Make sure your output for your program makes sense and looks proper.  Age input goes down a line and is very awkward.
Otherwise a lot of good work!
